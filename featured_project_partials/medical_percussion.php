    <p> I co-authored two academic research papers that quantified medical percussion for the first time. The papers won best presentation and best poster at the IROS RoPat20 workshop conference. We designed and built a percussion robot and collected test data from the device before analysing the data using wavelet transfrom and neural networks. <br><br> My focus was on training an accurate neural network to detect tissue anomalies from the scalogram generated from a percussion event.</p>
