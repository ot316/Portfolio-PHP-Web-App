    <p> I spent 6 months working for the Magic of Things, a company that uses IOT tech to create magical experiences for magic themed cocktail bars around the world.<br><br> I designed several products including this interactive fairy house and roled them out to one of our venues to gather feedback from users and venue staff. After implementing improvements to address my findings the products were shipped out around the world. </p>
