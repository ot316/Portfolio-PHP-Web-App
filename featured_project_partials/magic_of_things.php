    <p> I spent six months working for the Magic of Things ltd, a company that uses IOT tech to create magical experiences for fantasy themed cocktail bars around the world.<br><br> I designed and organised the production of several products including this interactive fairy house and rolled them out to one of our venues to gather feedback from users and venue staff. After implementing the user driven improvements the products were shipped out around the world. </p>
