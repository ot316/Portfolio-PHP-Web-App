    <p> Voxel is an IOT startup built on the principles of data privacy and hackability. Our modular line of products contain sensors, inputs and displays; powered by our open source software. <br> <br> My work involved developing the Voxel website and using it to validate interest with google analytics and a "fake door" purchase link. I communicated between users, contributers and potential investors and was also responsible for the hardware and software prototype development.</p>
