# Portfolio Website/Web App

Originally a static website, I converted my website into php to template html files efficiently. This allows me to make changes and add more projects efficiently. The web app is deployed to Heroku, which is linked directly to this repository and deploys new commits automatically. The media files are stored in an AWS S3 bucket and the SLL certificate is set up using cloudflare. I hope to add more advanced features in future.
